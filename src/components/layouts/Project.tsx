My role involved collaborating with various departments to create tailored ERP solutions that improved operational efficiency through the use of Agile methodologies and Scrum practices. I designed wireframes, created database schemas, and developed features in iterative sprints, accelerating delivery and optimizing team workflows. Additionally, I conducted comprehensive self-testing and troubleshooting for live issues, ensuring the system remained stable and user satisfaction was consistently achieved. I also worked closely with end-users to provide support and resolve technical issues, further enhancing the user experience. To facilitate a smoother onboarding process, I developed documentation to assist new team members in quickly integrating into the team and adapting to their roles.'

I was primarily responsible for implementing the real-time auction and contract management features, which included developing the auction closing logic and handling scenarios like bidding extensions and automatic win notifications. Additionally, I integrated an e-contract API (eFormSign) to facilitate secure and efficient digital transactions, reducing administrative overhead and enhancing user trust. I also contributed to the front-end development, creating an intuitive user interface to enhance engagement, using a server-side rendering (SSR) approach with Thymeleaf to ensure fast loading times and better SEO.'

The backend is deployed on AWS EC2, containerized with Docker, and managed through GitLab CI/CD for continuous integration and deployment. Swagger is utilized for generating comprehensive API documentation automatically. Currently, I am enhancing the front-end using a client-side rendering (CSR) approach with React and TypeScript to improve interactivity and provide a more dynamic user experience.'
